Exploratory Data Analysis on Heart Attack Dataset
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart attack dataset sourced from Kaggle. The main objective is to identify trends, correlations, and potential risk indicators associated with heart attacks using visual and statistical data analysis techniques.

Tools and Libraries Used
Python, Pandas (for data handling and preprocessing), Matplotlib & Seaborn (for data visualization), Jupyter Notebook

🔍 EDA Workflow Overview
Data Loading and Cleaning, Inspected the dataset using head(), info(), and describe(), Checked for missing values and data types, Encoded categorical variables where necessary, Visualization and Insights, Bar plots, histograms, and count plots for visual understanding.

Grouped analysis by:
Gender, State, Physical activity, Smoking, Alcohol consumption, Cholesterol

📈 Key Findings
After conducting EDA, the following insights were drawn:

📍 Regional Insight: The North-Eastern states of India show a relatively higher number of heart attack cases.

🚻 Gender: There is no significant difference in heart attack cases between males and females.

🍷 Alcohol Consumption: No clear link or correlation was found between alcohol consumption and heart attack incidence.

🏃 Physical Activity: Similarly, no direct correlation was observed between activity status and heart attacks.

📊 Conclusion: Heart attacks appear to be randomly distributed across different age groups, genders, and personal habits in this dataset.
